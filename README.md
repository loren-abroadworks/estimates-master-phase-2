# Estimate Master (EMTS) Replica

A front-end replica of the live Estimate Master app (app.estimate-master.com).
It reproduces the live screens and workflows using local mock data, so it can be the starting point for new features.

Application records are saved to localStorage and, when Supabase is configured, shared through the `app_state` table so everyone works on one copy. Sign-in is checked on the server (see **Sign-in** below). Supplier integration routes have a separate access gate.

## New features (merged from emts-prototype)

The 14 features from the EMTS feature prototype (User Stories and Final Design v1.0) are built into this replica. The **New Features** panel at the top of the dashboard switches each one on or off; its "Show NEW badges on screens" switch brings back the green **NEW** badges (and **Needs client confirmation** on features 33 and 34).

- **Inside the existing screens:**
  - Estimates: colour card, change orders, from history, preliminary list, amend rule.
  - Work orders: live status flow, materials and paint orders, crew clock and time log, closeout, "Use in marketing".
  - Jobs: cost and hours card.
  - Job Scheduling: crew actual hours.
  - Contacts: Paint History tab with QR links and reorders.
  - Leads: repaint follow-up, website lead review.
  - Reports: five new tabs.
  - Dashboard: new widgets and the demo walkthrough.
  - Invoices: QuickBooks state.
  - Settings: waste settings, deposit percent, rate versions and the paint catalogue.
- **New sidebar modules:** Time, Supplier Orders, Repaint Alerts, Accounting, Marketing.
  - Marketing's Media Library takes real photo uploads and records a customer's permission per photo (verbal or written, with a note). The Post Composer shows a Facebook and Instagram preview. Details in `docs/UI_CHANGES.md`; the plan for connecting Facebook and Instagram is `docs/emts-phase-2/11-meta-integration.md`.
- **New settings pages:** Social Accounts, Accounting, Suppliers, Repaint Intervals.
- **Demo tools:** the **Prototype** bar (bottom-left) switches the demo user to show the access rules, pins the clock, opens the feature tours and resets all demo data.
- **Feature tours:** one short guided tour per new feature, started from the **Feature tours** card on the dashboard or the **Tour** button in New Features. Each opens with what the feature solves, the flow before it and its Minimal and Complete versions (or "core module" for the 14 patent features), then walks add, update, delete and approve on the real screens, saying where each result shows. See `docs/UI_CHANGES.md`.

How it fits together:

- `features/` is the prototype's engine, ported as is: its data model, store, actions, rules and feature panels. The repo has 733 tests in 63 files (run `npm test`). Its docs are in the original prototype's `docs/` folder (DEV_HANDOFF.md, INTEGRATION_MAP.md).
- `lib/bridge/` keeps the two stores in step. A customer, lead, estimate, job, work order or invoice has the **same id** in both.
  - The prototype's demo story is projected into the replica collections.
  - Records made on replica screens are mirrored into the prototype.
  - Status changes go through the prototype's actions, so its rules apply. A refused change is rolled back with a toast.
- Core document numbers come from one shared sequence, and a new record's number is also its id.

## Automation module (6 Oct 2026, redesigned 7 Oct to the Figma "EMTS Automation (Workflows)")

Its own sidebar module after Reports. A business sets up each next step once (When, Only if, Then); deploying approves the steps to run on their own (Cross-Feature Rule 4, revised).

- Engine and rules: `lib/automations/` (registry, run engine, drop rules, readiness, validation, templates, sample messages). Tests: `lib/automations/*.test.ts`.
- Screens: `components/automations/workflows/` (Workflows list with folders, the canvas builder with Add trigger / Add action panels, Overview, Global Workflow Settings) and `components/automations/` (stage view, messages, templates, modals). The engine ticks from `AutomationsSync` and acts through the features actions as the person who deployed, so the app's rules apply.
- Messages share one library with Settings › Automated Messages and SMS Templates.
- Sending is sandboxed (mock provider, no limits) until a provider and its plan limits are set in Automation › Global Workflow Settings. Texting stays locked until released by the owner.

## Decisions of 2 Oct 2026 (D1–D7)

- **D1 – QuickBooks sync timing.** No more hourly 6 a.m.–6 p.m. window. A record is sent when it is saved, any time, any day.
  - A failed send retries after 1, 5, 30 and 120 minutes on the prototype clock. When the last retry fails, the record goes to **Accounting › Needs Attention**, which has a count badge, Retry, Open record and Dismiss.
  - Parents go first (Customer → Project → Invoice → Payment), and the idempotency key prevents duplicates. **Sync now** sends the queue at once.
  - **Accounting › Sync Log** lists every send, newest first: the last 7 days by default, 25 rows a page.
  - Settings › Accounting has a **Start sync** gate ("Map every tax region first"). A sent invoice says "Edit this invoice in QuickBooks".
- **D2 – Contact matching.** A QuickBooks customer matches a contact on email *or* exact display name. It is a possible duplicate only when the email points at one contact and the name at another, or the name matches several contacts.
- **D3 – QuickBooks is a paid add-on.** The add-on is an organisation flag, on for the demo; the Prototype bar has a toggle. Without it, Settings › Accounting shows "Add QuickBooks to your plan." With it, Owner and Admin (office manager) connect, disconnect, set sync options and confirm matches.
- **D4 – Lead form rate limit.** 5 submissions per hour per address.
- **D5 – Lead form fields** (`/website-form`):
  - Full name (2–80 characters).
  - US phone or email (one is required).
  - Property address.
  - "What would you like painted?" (Interior, Exterior, Both, Cabinets, Other).
  - Message (up to 1,000 characters).

  A match to an open lead still creates the lead, marked **Possible duplicate** with a link to the other lead.
- **D6 – Lead sources.** An organisation list in Settings › Pipeline Stages › **Lead sources**.
  - Eight are built in. Admins add, rename and deactivate the rest; a source with leads can't be deleted.
  - Tracked links, the board's Source filter and Group by Source all use the list.
- **D7 – Crew email.** The subject is "Schedule update from {Company}: {N} jobs changed" (Spanish too), and the template is "Schedule Update (crew)". The preview shows old dates crossed through beside the new ones.

## Run it

You need Node.js 20 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

Other commands:

- `npm run build` builds for production (all 62 routes build cleanly).
- `npm start` serves the production build.
- `npm run typecheck` runs TypeScript with no output.

To go back to the original sample data, open **Help & Support** and click **Reset demo data**, or use the Prototype bar. Both reset the replica and the feature data together.

## Tech stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router) and React 19
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Radix UI primitives (Dialog, Select, Dropdown Menu, Switch, Checkbox, Tabs, Popover, Tooltip)
- lucide-react icons

## How a record moves through the app

1. A lead is added on the Lead Pipeline and moved through the stages.
2. An estimate is built from a template (areas, surfaces, paint, tiers, extras, discount, tax).
3. The estimate is sent, and the customer approves it on the client view with a typed signature.
4. The approved estimate is converted to a job.
5. The job is scheduled, crew is assigned, and work orders are created.
6. An invoice is created from the job and payments are recorded.

Each step writes to the same local store, so the dashboard, reports and activity feed update right away.

## Working with data

Pages never import mock data directly. They use hooks from `lib/store.tsx`:

```tsx
const { items, add, update, remove } = useCollection('estimates');
const [config, setConfig] = useSingleton('generalConfig');
const nextNumber = useNextNumber();   // nextNumber('ESTIMATE') -> "EST-2026-16"
```

To connect a real backend later, replace the inside of these hooks with API calls. The pages can stay the same.

## Known differences from the live app

- The logo and presentation cover photos are placeholders (SVG and gradients), because the live image files were not in the source export.
- These are not built: file attachments, CSV contact import, rich-text email editing, and estimate packages (Good/Better/Best) inside the estimate builder. Package templates can still be managed in Settings.
- The payment gateway is simulated. Email and SMS run in sandbox until their keys are set (see [Email and SMS](#email-and-sms)). Configured supplier integrations can send real requests from the server.

## Sign-in

**Prototype sign-in (the default).** The sign-in page is shown, but any username and password get in, and the page says so. A known username (`tim`, `dana`, an email, `first.last`) signs you in as that person; anything else signs you in as the owner. No environment variables are needed for this. Set `AUTH_MODE=real` to switch to real password checking, described below, before any real customer data is entered.

With `AUTH_MODE=real`, passwords are checked on the server (`app/api/auth/*`, `lib/auth/server.ts`). A successful sign-in sets an HttpOnly, signed `emts_session` cookie for 12 hours, and `proxy.ts` redirects any staff page to `/login` without it. Customer links, the website form and API routes stay public. Passwords are stored only as scrypt hashes on the server: in Supabase `app_state` under a key `/api/state` never serves, or in server memory in local development without Supabase. Five failed attempts lock a username for 15 minutes on that server instance.

Set these private environment variables (never with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`):

| Variable | Needed | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Production | 32+ random characters that sign the session cookie. Without it nobody can sign in on a production build. |
| `AUTH_OWNER_PASSWORD` | Optional | Lets the owner sign in before any password has been set, to set everyone else's in Settings › Team Access. |
| `AUTH_DEMO_PASSWORDS` | Optional | `on` accepts the old demo passwords for people who have no password yet. On by default in development, off in production. Turn it off before real customer data is entered. |

The owner or office manager sets passwords in Settings › Team Access. Anyone can change their own after entering their current one. Signing in makes you the current user; only the owner can switch to another person with Prototype › Viewing as.

**Two people editing at once.** Each save names the version it started from. If someone else saved first, `/api/state` refuses it and the browser merges the two copies record by record (`lib/json-merge.ts`). Where both changed the same field, the other person's value is kept and a notice names the item. Other people's saves are picked up when the tab regains focus.

**Who can reach the shared data.** `/api/state` answers signed-in staff, and customer pages whose link carries a valid token: an estimate's customer token, a QR paint record or passport that isn't revoked, an active tracked link, or a published landing page (`lib/guest-access.ts`). Everyone else gets 401 and the page works on its own browser copy without saving.

**Not covered yet.** A customer holding a valid link still receives the whole shared copy, because the customer pages (for example estimate acceptance, which creates the job, work order and invoice) run on it in the browser. Before real customer data, move those actions onto the server and send customers only their own records. The demo seed's tokens are also public in the app's code, so they must not be used for real customers.

## Supplier access

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for local development and set a unique `SUPPLIER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` of at least 24 characters. Keep all supplier credentials server-side. In production use the hosting provider's private environment settings and HTTPS. The supplier routes return 503 until the password is configured, and 401 until authenticated.

Open Settings > Suppliers > **Sign in for live supplier access**, then use username `supplier-admin` and the configured password. This shared administrator gate protects supplier connection, order and inbox routes; it is not application-wide authentication. Supplier webhooks retain their separate signature verification.

## Email and SMS

Estimates' **Send to Customer** (Client Preview and the builder) and the lead stage messages go through `/api/messaging` (`features/lib/integrations/messaging-server.ts`). A channel runs in **sandbox** until all three of its variables are set on the server: the message is only recorded (id `SBX-…`) and nothing reaches the customer. The estimate then shows "Sandbox — not really sent: email keys not set".

| Variable | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `MESSAGING_EMAIL_ENDPOINT_URL` | https endpoint that accepts `{ from, to, subject, body, tag }` and returns `{ messageId }` or `{ id }` |
| `MESSAGING_EMAIL_API_KEY` | Sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` |
| `MESSAGING_FROM_EMAIL` | Sender address |
| `MESSAGING_SMS_ENDPOINT_URL`, `MESSAGING_SMS_API_KEY`, `MESSAGING_FROM_PHONE` | The same for SMS (`{ from, to, body, tag }`, sender in E.164) |

A live channel also needs the supplier administrator sign-in above (`SUPPLIER_ADMIN_PASSWORD`), so the route can't be used as an open relay. Each estimate send is saved on the estimate (`Estimate.deliveries`: time, recipient, channel, `delivered` / `sandbox` / `failed`, error, provider message id), logged in Activity, and shown as a badge next to the status. The estimate becomes Sent only when a message was delivered or sandboxed. A failed send keeps the status and shows the reason with a Retry button.

See [the code gap review](docs/CODE_GAP_REVIEW.md) for the implemented fixes, verification and remaining production work.
