/**
 * Product tour: the shape of a feature tour and its steps.
 *
 * There is one short tour per new feature, written in ./feature-tours.ts. Each
 * opens with an overview card (what it solves, the flow before it, and its
 * Minimal and Complete versions, or "core module" for the fourteen patent
 * features built as one package), then walks the actions on the real
 * screens: add, update, delete, approve, send or view. Every action step says
 * how it was done before, what you do here, and where the result shows.
 *
 * A step's `target` names a `data-tour="..."` anchor on the page. If the
 * anchor isn't rendered (another role, or the data has changed), the callout
 * shows centred instead of pointing at nothing.
