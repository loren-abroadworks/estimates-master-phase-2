/**
 * One short tour per new feature (New Features panel order).
 *
 * The fourteen patent features are core modules: built and delivered as one
 * package, with no Minimal / Complete split. The client-call features
 * tag each step with the version it belongs to. Every action step says how it
 * was done before (`before`), what you do (`body`) and where the result shows
 * (`shows`). Each stop opens a seeded record that already shows its scenario
 * (see data/seed.ts).
 *
 * "Before" for the 30 Sep features is taken from their specs
 * (docs/emts-phase-2). For the core modules it describes the live app with
 * the feature switched off, and needs the client's confirmation.
