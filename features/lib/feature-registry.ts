/**
 * Every new feature in the prototype, in one list (New Features panel).
 *
 * The dashboard panel reads it to list the features and where to find them;
 * the gates (features/components/ui/live.tsx FeatureGate) read the same keys
 * to show or hide each feature's parts. Names follow the feature headers in
 * the code ("Feature N — …").
 *
 * Built features (the 14 patent features) have no Minimal / Complete split:
 * their Minimal switch is "the feature as built". The client-call features
 * list their item IDs (QB-M1 …) under Minimal and Complete.
 *
 * Names follow the client's module list (Settings › New Modules). Estimate
 * Master Books ("bk") has no row of its own: it shows with Feature 33,
 * Financial and Accounting Management (BOOKS_FOLLOWS in feature-visibility).
